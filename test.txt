1. Working Area – Local system. files which are untracked are part of the working area. 

2. Staging Area – This area is used to create the version of files. This is the area where Git will know what changes will be done from last version to the new version. 

3. Files to move from working area to Staging area – Git Add <file name> 
	Files to move from Staging area to working area – Git -rm cached <file name>
	(At times might be possible we get to know changes are not proper and hence move back those files from Staging area 	to working and make required changes) 

4. Repository Area – All files with previous registered versions. Files within this area git manage the version history.

5. git add <filename> - move files from working area to staging area  

6. Git commit -m “message” move files from Staging area to Local Repository area 
	Every commit is a version. It captures a snapshot of the projects stage changes 

7. Git log – To see all the commits. If you want to exit out of Git log from press “q” 
	

8. Git Restore <file> - To delete all changes from the staging area to be committed. At times if developer writes the code 
			which is not useful then at that time they can use this instead of manully deleting codes 
			git restore work for working area where you can do trial and error with code once sure then comit those
			changes 

9. git diff commit ID - This will help you understand / track what changes have been done from previous commit 

10. git remote - list down all remote connection names 

11. Remote connection - This helps to connect local repo with remote repo for upload and download changes
